# CoronavirusModelMarchToApril

This is a quick exponential model I made in March to model the cumulative cases in the UK from March 22nd to April 22nd. 

With researching into the statistics, I had to consider three different rates of increase (35%, 25%, and 15%) since the rate of increase is not exactly the same on a day to day basis. Furthermore, the data is limited by the testing capacity of the UK. Therefore, due to testing limitations, some information may be inaccurate. 

Information received almost match with official numbers within a margin of error.
